## Travel Agency Website – UI/UX Design

This project is a multi-frame travel website I designed in Figma.  
By the time I started this one, I felt a little more familiar moving between screens and frames, but it still challenged me.  

I explored layouts, spacing, color, and navigation across five sections: home, destinations, packages, about, and contact.  
Each frame represents a small step in understanding user experience, visual hierarchy, and flow between screens.  

This project taught me that growth doesn’t happen in straight lines.  
Even after multiple drafts, restarting, and questioning choices, the final design became something that felt right a reflection of persistence, learning, and patience.
