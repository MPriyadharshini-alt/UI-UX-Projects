This repository holds the UI/UX design projects I created throughout my learning journey.  
I started UI/UX knowing almost nothing not even how to use Figma properly. But with every small attempt,
every frame, and every experiment, I slowly found my style and confidence.

Most of these projects are simple, self-initiated practice works. They may not be client-based,
but each one represents a step forward in my growth as a designer a reminder of how far I have come
from the day I opened Figma for the first time.
