This is my first proper UI/UX design project, a single-frame artist portfolio.  
When I started, I had almost no idea how to use Figma, and every attempt felt like chaos.

The final design isn’t just a frame; it’s the result of persistence, patience, and learning to trust my decisions.  
It represents a small but meaningful milestone from knowing nothing to creating something that feels like *me*.
