## Film Maker Portfolio – UI/UX Design

This is my first multi-frame prototype project in Figma.  
Starting was the hardest part. I had a vision in my mind, but it took weeks just to open the first frame and get going.  

Once I started, designing became fun. I explored layouts, spacing, colors, and interactions across all frames, paying attention not only to what looks good but also to how the prototype flows.  
Each frame represents a step in learning how to bring a vision to life in a way that’s both visually appealing and functional.

This project taught me patience, persistence, and the importance of quiet focus.  
From hesitation and self-doubt to finally seeing the design come alive, it captures my first real experience building a prototype in Figma.
